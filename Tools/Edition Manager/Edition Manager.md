These include Cut, Release, Source, Resolution, DynamicRange, VideoCodec, FrameRate, AudioCodec, Bitrate, Size, Country, ContentRating, Rating, and Duration. You can choose any number of modules and arrange them in any order. If certain modules cannot retrieve information, the others will still display correctly. Customize as needed.

### Cut
The Cut module currently supports 13 types of cut versions. This module prioritizes matching cut version information based on the movie's filename. If multiple video files exist, it will use the largest file by size for matching. If cut version information cannot be found through filename, it will attempt to match using embedded video titles within the file. If cut version information still cannot be found, it will not write cut version information. The supported cut versions are:

- **Theatrical Cut**: This version is shown in theaters and is typically the most widely recognized version. It undergoes final review by producers and distributors for large-scale release.
- **Director's Cut**: This version is considered by the director to best reflect their creative intent. It may include deleted scenes or have a different narrative structure, often released after the theatrical run.
- **Producer's Cut**: Edited under the supervision of producers, this version may differ from the director's intent. Producer's cuts sometimes modify the film for commercial reasons.
- **Extended Cut**: Includes scenes cut from the theatrical release or extends certain segments. Extended editions are usually released in home video formats to provide more content to viewers.
- **Unrated Cut**: A version not reviewed by film rating boards, often containing more intense or controversial content. Unrated versions are generally released in the home entertainment market.
- **Final Cut**: This is the definitive version of the film, incorporating input from all creative teams. Final cuts may be released to commemorate important anniversaries of the film.

```
[server]
# IP address and port of the Plex Server
address = http://localhost:32400
#Your Plex token
token = your_plex_token
skip_libraries = library_to_skip

[modules]
# Order of modules to apply, separated by semicolons
# Available modules: Resolution, DynamicRange, Duration, Rating, Cut, Release, Country, ContentRating, Language
order = Cut;Release;Language

[language]
# Languages to exclude from the Language module, separated by commas
# Example: English, French, German
excluded_languages = English
skip_multiple_audio_tracks = yes

[rating]
# Source for movie ratings
# Options: imdb, rotten_tomatoes
source = rotten_tomatoes
