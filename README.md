## [Tools / Edition Manager](https://github.com/Entree3k/Plex/blob/main/Tools/Edition%20Manager/Edition%20Manager.md)

The **Tools/Edition Manager** provides utilities for managing editions of your media files.

In Plex, there are two concepts of "version": "[Edition](https://support.plex.tv/articles/multiple-editions/)" and "[Version](https://support.plex.tv/articles/200381043-multi-version-movies/)", but their uses are quite different.
Edition Manager
Edition Manager is a powerful tool designed to enhance your Plex media library by leveraging the Edition feature to display rich, customizable metadata for your movies.

# Key Features:

1. Metadata Enhancement: Extracts and displays crucial information such as resolution, audio codecs, content ratings, and more.
2. Customizable Modules: Allows users to choose which information to display and in what order.
3. Backup and Restore: Provides options to backup and restore metadata, ensuring you can always revert changes.
4. Plex Integration: Seamlessly integrates with your Plex server, updating movie information directly in the Plex interface.
